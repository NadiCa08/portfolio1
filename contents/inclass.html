    <div>Day 2 a class activity that stood out to me was learning how to use CSS styles. So intriguing to see the backend structure and elements go into creating a website and page.<br>

    <div>Day 3 we went over Bootstrap - 4 Grid. It is still all new to me, but with practice I will be able to <span><b>dream</b></span> about this and have a <span><b>dreamy, out-of-this world website.</b></span>

    <div>Week 2 came around quick and we learned how to you use the bash command line, how to access GitHub and our intro to Python began.
